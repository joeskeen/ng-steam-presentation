        Hi, I'm Joe Skeen, and I'm an Angular developer.

        Hi, I'm Gwen Skeen. I'm almost six years old, and I'm an Angular developer.

    <div class="gwen">
        Today we're here to talk about STEM.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        The world I'm growing up in is different from the world my parents grew up in. We are expected
        to know a lot more about technology.
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        To be able to solve the problems of tomorrow, there is a big emphasis in education to teach
        STEM: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        Learning about these can be hard sometimes, and can even be boring.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        Before I could read and write, I explored my world with my hands, ears, and other senses.
        I could create and experiment with things in my world.   
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        It's for this reason, there is a movement to change STEM education to STEAM, encouraging 
        creativity by adding 'Art' to the mix.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        But what does this have to do with programming?
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        Because Angular can put the 'A' into STEAM.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        Hold on Daddy, you're getting ahead of yourself.
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        You're right.
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="joe">
        As Gwen has grown up, she has always taken an interest in the programming I am doing.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        Last year, I got to come to ng-conf with my Dad and go to ng-conf kids.  I got to make able
        program using Scratch and control a computer with a banana.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        I used Scratch to make my Mom a Mother's Day card.
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        We continued to do programming together.  I discovered studio.code.org, a website that helps
        kids of all ages to learn programming concepts, whether they are pre-readers, or high school
        students.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        My favorite things on code.org are helping the zombie from Plants vs. Zombies get to the flower 
        and making patterns in the ice with Elsa and Anna from Frozen.
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        To get Gwen familiar with Angular, I started at the quick start plunker from angular.io. Gwen
        was able to see how making changes to the HTML or CSS would change the output on the right.
        We continued to experiment as I showed her how Angular templating worked.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        We made an Angular app to pick your favorite color. When you click a button, it would change 
        the color of the words at the top.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        Then we made it so that you could use the button to vote for your favorite color.
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="joe">
        Doing programming with Gwen has been a fun and rewarding experience. She has learned so much
        more than I originally expected.  Together we make a great programming team.  
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        I love programming because you can make fun things.  I hope that as I get older I can do
        more programming.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        If you have kids, you should try programming with them. Just make sure you stay with them
        to help them when they have questions.
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        In conclusion, I would like to share a quote from President Barack Obama about making STEAM
        a more interactive experience:
        <blockquote>
            “[Science] is more than a school subject, or the periodic table, or the properties of waves. 
            It is an approach to the world, a critical way to understand and explore and engage with the 
            world, and then have the capacity to change that world..."
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="joe">
        I know as we spend quality time helping kids to learn programming, they will be better
        prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.
    </div>
    <div class="gwen">
        Thank you everybody!
